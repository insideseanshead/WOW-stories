          <h1>WOW Story from Touchmark at Mount Bachelor Village</h1>
          <div class="community-story">
            <p>
              Touchmark at Harwood Grove (TFND), prospective residents and
              neighbors John & Jo have been coming to Touchmark events for
              several years. Due to some changes in Jo's health, a majority of
              the cooking, cleaning, driving, and household chores were falling
              on John. The TFND sales team decided to surprise and delight them.
              They provided them with a food care package from the Touchmark
              kitchen courtesy of Ashley Thompson. The team delivered several
              days' worth of food as a basket, and John shared how their
              relationship began after John had delivered a May Day basket to Jo
              many years ago. Their mothers were in cahoots, and John's mom had
              called ahead to Jo's mom, letting her know John was on his way
              over with a May Day basket. A kiss was shared, and the rest is
              history!
            </p>

              The team received the following card from John and Jo: Melinda &
              Crew: The world is a little brighter thanks to you, Touchmark, for
              making our day very special. What great treats! The food was over
              the top. We enjoyed every morsel and our fun visit. Kudos to the
              chefs. No doubt the nicest May Basket we have ever received! John
              & Jo Lawrence
