          <h1>What is a WOW story?</h1>
          <p>
            A WOW story is a specific example of an interaction or experience
            that shows the incredible lengths a team member has taken to solve a
            unique problem, delight someone, or go out of their way and typical
            job responsibilities in service of others. Examples can include
            planning a milestone celebration, after-hours help, volunteering
            extra help during a crisis or inclement weather, visiting someone in
            need off-campus, celebrating a legacy or life in a special way, etc.
